Revision 1.2.0

-Modified the CoCo 3 board layout to better match the original.

-Routed the CoCo 3 board to better match original routing. While routing
 I found that some of the components although logically correct in how 
 they were connected, were not connected how they are on an original
 board. For example, the connections to the resistor networks from
 other components did not follow the order found in the original board.
 This is not a logical problem because all of the components are still
 connected to a resistor of the same value.
 
-On an original CoCo 3 board, pin 39 of the GIME is connected to VCC1
 which is a net that provides +5V from one end of a ferrite bead that is
 fed from +5V.
 The original schematic found in the service manual as well as the 
 cleaned up schematic made by Sopko shows pin 39 being connected to 
 directly to the +5V rail. This is not a big deal but nevertheless, I've 
 updated this schematic to reflect how the CoCo 3 board actually is.
    
-The BOM, IBOM, rendered image and schematic have all been updated.
-this version of the project now requires KiCAD 7 or above.
